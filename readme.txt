== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I show the testimonials? =

First you need to set your Freemius API credentials, this can be done in `WordPress admin area` > `Settings` > `General` > `Testimonials for Freemius â€“ API credentials`
After that, just use this shortcode **after changing 999 with your plugin/theme ID** `[freemius-testimonials plugin=999]`

= How can I sort testimonials? =

Testimonials can be sorted by their IDs. To get testimonial IDs, head over to the page which shows reviews, and add ``?fs-testimonial-ids` to the url.
So for example, if our testimonials showing page is on `http://example.com/testimonials/` then we will change the URL so it looks like `http://example.com/testimonials/?fs-testimonial-ids`.
This will display all testimonial IDs if you are logged in and have permission to edit posts on site.

Then, we just add `order` parameter with comma separated list of testimonial IDs and reviews will appear in that order, reviews not in the list will appear at the end.
Here is what the shortcode may look like `[freemius-testimonials plugin='999' order='295,349,241,290,227']` **change 999 with your plugin/theme ID AND 295,349,241,290,227 with your desired order**

= How can I use that expandable drawer like thingy? =

Just add `compress` to have some of your reviews hidden by default, a button to display all reviews will be added ;)
You can use this shortcode after replacing 999 with your plugin ID `[freemius-testimonials compress plugin=999]`
